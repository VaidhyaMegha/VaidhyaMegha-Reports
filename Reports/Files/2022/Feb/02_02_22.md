By seeing above two charts of analysis which were performed on 1st Feb 2022 and 25th Jan 2022 , we can observe that the changes of percentages of some trials in two weeks approximately.


| S. No. |             Trial Condition            | % Of first analysis | % Of second analysis |       Remarks      |
|:------:|:--------------------------------------:|:-------------------:|:--------------------:|:------------------:|
| 1      | Covid -19                              | 33.8                | 33.5                 | Increased by 0.3%  |

| 5      | Knee Osteoarthritis                    | 4.64                | 4.64                 | No Change |
| 6      | Mental Issues                          | 4.12                | 4.13                 | Decreased by 0.01% |
| 7      | Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases | 4.05                | 4.06                 | Decreased by 0.01% |
| 8      | Pain                                   | 3.87                | 3.90                 | Decreased by 0.03% |
| 9      | O- Medical and Surgical                | 3.66                | 3.67                 | Decreased by 0.01% |
| 10     | Stroke                                 | 3.60                | 3.63                 | Decreased by 0.03% |

From the above there is a 0.3% increment in Covid-19 and 0.02% increment in Healthy Volunteers.
