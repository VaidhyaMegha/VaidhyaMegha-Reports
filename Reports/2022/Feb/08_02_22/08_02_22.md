By seeing above two charts of analysis which were performed on 8th Feb 2022 and 1st Feb 2022 , we can observe that the changes of percentages of some trials in a week approximately.


| S. No. |             Trial Condition            | % Of first analysis | % Of second analysis |       Remarks      |
|:------:|:--------------------------------------:|:-------------------:|:--------------------:|:------------------:|
| 1      | Covid -19                              | 33.9                | 33.7                 | Increased by 0.2%  |

| 7      | Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases | 42                | 44                 | Decreased by 02% |
| 8      | Pain                                   | 3.90                | 3.89                 | Increased by 01% |
| 9      | O- Medical and Surgical                | 3.66                | 3.65                 | Increased by 01% |

The above table represents the increment in clinical trials registrations in a week approximately.
From the above table, clinical trials on Covid-19 were registered from almost every Source. Diabetes Mellitus , Psychological problems and Stroke are also health issues in almost every nation.
